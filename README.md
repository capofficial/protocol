# CAP v4 Solidity Contracts

## TODO

For details on how the margin / trading system works, please check the [Whitepaper](https://www.cap.finance/whitepaper.pdf), specifically sections 4 and 4.4. Liquidation Rebates and Interest Rate no longer apply.

The items below are listed in priority order. All milestones are **ASAP**, with a target production launch date of **early January** on Arbitrum. The driving factor is high quality, speed, and code simplicity.
 
- [x] Add automated tests, including fuzzy, to achieve > 90% coverage
- [x] Refactor code while maintaining readability
- [ ] Run auditing tools, get more eyes on the contracts
- [ ] Deploy and test locally with the [UI](https://github.com/capofficial/ui) to make sure everything is working as expected
- [x] Create production deploy scripts

## Done

- [x] Add methods "depositThroughUniswap" and "addLiquidityThroughUniswap" to allow deposits from a contract like Uniswap Router, to allow people to deposit any asset which is then automatically converted into the Store-supported currency. Potentially support other DEXes like 1inch.
- [x] Verify Chainlink contract works as expected for Arbitrum and its sequencer. Support all other Chainlink networks (or have a custom Chainlink contract for each chain)
- [x] If submitOrder margin exceeds freeMargin, set it to the max freeMargin available
- [x] Treasury fees should be paid out to a treasury address directly (set by gov)
- [x] Add MAX_FEE and other constants in Store to curtail gov powers in methods marked with onlyGov. The goal is to prevent gov from having too much power over system function, like setting a fee share too high and siphoning all the funds.
- [x] All orders including market should execute through keepers, which can be anyone, either after minSettlementTime or if chainlink price changes
- [x] Trigger orders execute at the chainlink price, not the price they've set
- [x] Give traders option to retrieve margin, closing without profit, when P/L > 0. Useful in black swan scenarios to get their margin back.
- [x] Flat fee
- [x] Allow submitting TP/SL with an order
- [x] Contracts: Trade, Pool, Store, Chainlink


## Compiling

```
forge build
```

## Testing

```
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=lite forge test --match-contract <test_contract_name> -vvvv
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=lite forge test --match-test <test_function_name> -vvvv
```

Static code analysis with slither
```
slither .
```

## Deploying locally

```
anvil
forge install
forge script DeployLocalScript --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --broadcast -vvvv
```

## Deploying

Set environment variables in .env and load them with
```
source .env
```
Then run the deploy script
```
forge script script/DeployProd.sol:DeployProd --broadcast --verify -vvvv
```
